The air smells like rotten eggs, making me feel kind of sick.

When I was ten years old, I was caught in a traffic accident- that part of memory has been blurry, and all I remember is that I wake up in the hospital seeing the doctors, my friends and family screaming, crying and trying to hug me. Everyone says it&rsquo;s a miracle, that I was caught into such a big accident and still managed to survive somehow, without even getting any disability. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The recovery went very smoothly, as I was able to leave the hospital and go back to school within several months; when I thought everything was over and ready to return to my ordinary life, something happened that changed my entire life. </span></p><hr><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">(3) </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">My classmates still remembered me- actually, after such a long time we didn&rsquo;t see each other, and with the fact that I just recovered from a huge accident, everyone was even showing extra kindness to me, which made me become the center of attention everywhere I went. I even started to think it&rsquo;s possibly a good thing to be caught in that accident. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">During lunch, &nbsp;I was surrounded by my friends who were eager to know how I could survive it and came back to school so soon; everytime I had to explain that it was all about fortune, and enjoyed how they were amazed and jealous of me for having such an extraordinary experience. I was so immersed in such joy that I didn&rsquo;t even hear the bell rang- when I realized it, I was already late for my psychology class. I grabbed my bag, rushed out of the cafeteria, failed to notice there was someone behind the cafeteria door. </span></p><hr><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">(4) </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">I directly rushed into him- my geology teacher, Mr.A; he was holding a water bottle and all of his class materials. Normally he would definitely go mad at me for hitting him, but something magical happened- at the moment I hit him, I strange feeling came to my mind, and suddenly the world went slow- he dropped his water bottle, but in the eyes of mine, the bottle was like doing a slow motion, still in the air; I tried to reach the bottle before it hit the ground, and I found I was able to move my arm with a normal speed, allowing me to captured the bottle even before it hit the ground; I can even see how Mr.A&rsquo;s facial expression changed so slowly, from anger to astonishment. </span></p><hr><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">(5) </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">That was the first time when I awakened my super power. But starting from then, I became more prudent and cautious- I tried to hide my special ability, because I didn&rsquo;t want to be seen as a weirdo or a monster. However, this ability of mine really brought me much convenience, as I became adept at using it: when I tried to focus and excite myself, the time seemed like frozen to me, so that I can utilize it to do many extra things- I got almost infinite time for a school quiz or test, so it was such a piece of cake for me to earn a high grade at school. My life became much more smoother- everyone around me call me a genius, for I can remember any hard concepts within a few seconds; my physical ability was also increased into a non-human level, that I think I can easily won any golden medal in any sport competition, or break any world records, as long as I try- but I chose not too. I still kept living my life in an ordinary way. Sometimes I used my ability to help people, without getting noticed of it. I started to get used to such a life. </span></p><hr><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">(6) </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">One day when the school was over, I decided to take the subway home because there happened to be something wrong with my car, that it didn&rsquo;t move when I stepped on the gas pedal. There was no one else in the train, which was pretty rare at that time period. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The train started moving. As it went faster and faster, I had a feeling that something was wrong; there was a weird smell, like gasoline, and a strange noise was getting louder and louder. Suddenly I heard an explosion, and the whole carriage got enclosed by fire. </span></p><hr><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">(7&#65289; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo; Looks like you get back some memories, huh?&rdquo; The man smiles at me. &ldquo;It has been ten years since that explosion- in other words, you&rsquo;ve been sleeping for ten years.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Who are you?

It controls your muscle movement, and also your logic and reasonings.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo; I suppose that you remembered that car accident when you were a kid. During the surgery, you received a special treatment - they used a special radiation that could alter the function of your frontal lobe.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Radiation?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;The SH-Radiation. It has been developing for a long time, since the very time we human beings had discovered biological-psychology. The SH-Radiation is able to boost people&rsquo;s reacting speed, reasoning ability and physical ability by altering some biological functions of their frontal lobe and nerve system, therefore arousing the full potential of human brains. This is the reason why you can think, move and analyze at an incredibly high rate.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;So that-&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Right. Link, you are the first test subject who received the SH-Radiation Treatment.&rdquo; He says. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">I try to stay calm. &ldquo;Why should I believe in you? Who are you anyway?

Starting from billionaires, and then entrepreneurs, merchants, celebrities, finally lawyers and doctors- people who received the SH-Radiation became literally supermen- their intellectual and physical abilities surpassed the ordinary people by much, so they could have overwhelming advantages when competing with ordinary people. They were referred to as the &lsquo;New Generation&rsquo;.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;-&lsquo;New Generation-?&rsquo;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. With their overwhelming abilities, the New Generation was able to take control over more than 95.7% of the land, wealth and properties on earth- and the number is still increasing- in contrast, the normal people have to give up their living spaces and properties, only work at the bottom of the society, doing heavy labors and struggling simply to survive.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t that unlawful--?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Nothing they did is against the law- actually, the New Generation has total control over politics; the laws are made to protect their interests to start with.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;In that case, why don&rsquo;t people just revolt?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;There were rebellions- however, the New Generation also controls the army.

There should be lots more poor people who cannot afford that SH-Radiation thing.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Most of them are dead.
